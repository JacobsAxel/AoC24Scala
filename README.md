# AoC24Scala
https://adventofcode.com/2024

My personal solutions for advent of code 2024 written in scala, to learn scala.
I might optimize them while writing or later, but that would take time and/or deeper understanding of scala which I both do not have.
As long as they are not O(n^2) abominations I will be satisfied, although I might get more desperate on the harder problems.
